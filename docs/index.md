Software Development Context (Backstage by Spotify):
Backstage is an open source developer portal framework originally created by Spotify, designed to unify and manage software infrastructure, developer tooling, and technical documentation in a centralized place.
It provides a consistent user interface that organizes microservices, infrastructure, and software tools, enabling engineering teams to work autonomously yet with visibility and standards.
